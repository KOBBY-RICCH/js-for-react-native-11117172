## Student ID : 11117172
### Overview
This project consists of JavaScript functions that perform various manipulations on arrays and user profiles. The tasks are divided into three main parts, each encapsulated in its own JavaScript file.
### Task 1: arrayManipulation.js
**Functions:**
- `processArray(arr)`: 
  - Takes an array of numbers as an argument.
  - Returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
    **Example Usage:**
```javascript
const inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const processedArray = processArray(inputArray);
console.log(processedArray); // Output: [3, 4, 9, 16, 15]
